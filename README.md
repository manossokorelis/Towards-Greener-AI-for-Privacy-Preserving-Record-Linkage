# Towards-Greener-AI-for-Privacy-Preserving-Record-Linkage
This work investigates the convergence of accuracy, privacy, and energy efficiency in a novel Entity Resolution (ER) process. The study focuses on analyzing the impact of integrating differential privacy and deep learning into an ER workflow using Bloom filters. Specifically, it examines the CPU energy consumption and total RAM usage to assess the trade-offs between privacy preservation, computational efficiency, and model performance.
