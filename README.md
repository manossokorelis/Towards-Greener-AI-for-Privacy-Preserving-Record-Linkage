# Towards-Greener-AI-for-Privacy-Preserving-Record-Linkage
This work, conducted as part of my thesis at the University of Macedonia, investigates the convergence of accuracy, privacy, and energy efficiency in a novel Entity Resolution (ER) process. The study focuses on analyzing the impact of integrating differential privacy and deep learning into an ER workflow using Bloom filters. Specifically, it examines the CPU energy consumption and total RAM usage to assess the trade-offs between privacy preservation, computational efficiency, and model performance.

Key Achievements:
- Designed and implemented an innovative ER process that integrates differential privacy and deep learning with Bloom filters to enhance data privacy while maintaining high model performance.
- Conducted a comprehensive analysis of how different configurations of Bloom filters, neural network models, and training parameters impact privacy preservation, accuracy, and energy consumption. Highlighted the intricate balance required for optimal performance.
- Focused on reducing the energy consumption of deep learning models during both training and inference phases by experimenting with smaller training sets (few-shot learning) and cross-dataset evaluation techniques, ensuring that energy usage was minimized without significant loss in accuracy or privacy.
- Utilized tools like PyRAPL to measure CPU energy consumption and RAM usage in real-time, offering novel insights into the computational cost of privacy-preserving methods integrated into ER workflows.
- Explored cross-dataset evaluation and model reuse strategies to show how pre-trained models could save energy and reduce training time, while ensuring model performance remained consistent across different datasets.
