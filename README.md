# Towards-Greener-AI-for-Privacy-Preserving-Record-Linkage

This repository contains a sample code from my university thesis, which explores the intersection of accuracy, privacy, and energy efficiency in deep learning-based entity resolution (ER). The research integrates differential privacy and Bloom filters to enhance privacy while optimizing energy consumption. 

Repository Structure:
- encoding_data.py: Contains a sample code for generating similarity and difference features between pairs of Bloom filters.
- evaluateNN.py: Implements the training and evaluation of a neural network for entity resolution.
- data: Sample datasets which used in the study.
